I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided by the instructor for this project. 
I understand that copying source code from any other source, providing source code to another student, or leaving my code on a public website constitutes cheating. 
I acknowledge that if I am found in violation of this policy this may result in a zero grade, a permanent record on file, and possibly immediate failure of the class.

<!-- WARNING-Please do not copy/paste any of this code.  You may utilize the concepts here 
but I don't want to see a bunch of assignments with the exact layout, class names etc.  
Type every line of code yourself!  Change the names, be creative, make the assignment your own!

TRICK:  select all text in this file, 'Ctrl-A', then use 'Alt-Shift-f' to format your document with proper indents etc.

			<h2>My personal interests</h2>
			<p>I've always been fascinated by coding and the endless possibilities it offers. Writing lines of code feels like constructing a complex puzzle, where each piece must fit perfectly for the final product to function. There's something incredibly rewarding about debugging an issue and watching your creation come to life on the screen.</p>
			<p>When I'm not coding for class or working, I love spending time playing video games. I enjoy exploring vast digital worlds, whether I'm embarking on an epic adventure or challenging friends in competitive matches. Video games provide both an entertaining escape and a way to connect with people who share my passion for gaming.</p>
			<p>Another big interest of mine is Dungeons & Dragons (DND). I'm drawn to the imaginative storytelling and the collaborative nature of the game, where each player's decisions can shape the entire campaign. From rolling dice to crafting detailed backstories for my characters, DND allows me to dive into a realm of creativity and shared adventure.</p>
